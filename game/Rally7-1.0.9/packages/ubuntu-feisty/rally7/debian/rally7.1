.SH NAME
rally7 \- a car racing game from Infukor inspired by an arcade classic with a
similar name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rally7
[OPTION]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Rally 7
is a car racing game from Infukor inspired by an arcade classic with a
similar name. Written in Python and using
.B Pygame
and
.BR Numeric ,
it should be playable on a number of different platforms given a fast enough
computer.
.PP
The aim of the game is to navigate your car around the rally course - a maze
surrounded by scenery - collecting flags and avoiding rocks and the red cars,
making sure that the flags are cleared before your fuel runs out. If the red
cars get too close, a smoke screen can be created to make them crash, but
since this uses fuel, it may be best not to do so too often.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-fullscreen
Try and run the game in fullscreen mode
.TP
.BR \-\-halfsize , " \-\-small"
Use a game window or display which is half the usual width and height
.TP
.B \-\-medium

height
.TP
.B \-\-no-sound
Mute the sound output from the game
.TP

.TP
.B \-\-no-audio

.SH LIMITATIONS
On some systems, sound output may be managed by some kind of mixing system;
for example, KDE uses a system called aRts for this purpose. To work in such
environments, you will need to specify a special command before
.BR python .
.PP
For example:
.RS 4
.PP
.PD 0
.B artsdsp python rally7.py --fullscreen
.PP
.B artsdsp rally7 --fullscreen
.RE
.PD
.PP
Alternatively, you can try and switch off the mixing system.

.IP F3 14
Large display
.IP F4 14
Fullscreen mode
.IP F5 14

.PP
Note that in fullscreen mode, the large display may not actually scale to a
larger size on screen than the small or medium size displays; this is due to
the way particular monitors or screens perform scaling of graphical output.
(On the 1280x1024 LCD monitor used for testing, the medium display scaled
better than the large display, for example.)
